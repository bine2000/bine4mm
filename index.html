	<h6> 
		<strong> legend of Medusa </strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<br>
	  is a Greek legend and goddess and her beauty was so enchanting that all men fell in love with her
	  The gods promised Athena to be a priestess on the condition that she preserve her virginity
		
	    In fact, she was very conservative
		Once upon a time, she was near the sea
		Until the sea god Beseiden saw her.
		He saw her and fell in love with her
	    I answered his love with no
       
		Because she was keeping her promise to become a priestess
		I was raped by his hand
		He assaulted her in spite of her

		At this time, the goddess Athena was angry with her and decided to punish her for bringing shame to her
		They made her look ugly, her skin green, and her hair all snakes
		The person who gets close to her will turn to stone
		 Until Perseus came and used the goddess Athena to help her and kill her, 
		 and indeed he killed her and got rid of her, but she was pregnant
